# Air Quality In Alberta

Air quality is a critical determinant of public health, with long-term exposure to poor air quality linked to various adverse health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) as pollutants with strong empirical evidence for public health concern. Health problems can occur as a result of both short- and long-term exposure to these pollutants . Alberta with its diverse landscape and economic activities – including urbanization, industrial operations and natural events like wildfires` faces unique challenges in maintaining healthy air quality. Monitoring and understanding these impacts is essential for developing policies that protect public health while supporting sustainable growth. 

My team's project began with an exploration of Alberta’s Air Quality Health Index (AHQI), aiming to understand how factors such as urbanization, industrial activity, and natural events like wildfires influences air quality. Air quality directly impacts public health, making it a critical topic for analysis. However, as we delved into the data, we encountered challenges such as inconsistencies in temporal granularity and limited data availability, especially when trying to analyze the AQHI across municipalities over an extended period. These obstacles led us to reevaluate our focus. 

Through initial exploration, we found that life expectancy, another critical public health indicator, aligned with many variables we were investigating for AQHI. The shift to life expectancy as our primary focus allowed us to leverage the same datasets more effectively while addressing gaps in AQHI data. Additionally, life expectancy provided a more robust dependent variable, allowing for meaningful analysis of its relationships with demographic, environmental, and economic factors. This transition enabled us to draw connections between trends in life expectancy and variables like population growth, housing developments, and vehicle registrations, which all tie into broader societal and environmental dynamics. 

Throughout the project, we aimed to explore the factors that most significantly influence life expectancy in Alberta. Our analysis focuses on uncovering relationships between demographic trends, such as population growth and age distribution, and changes in life expectancy across municipalities. Additionally, we investigate how environmental factors, like air quality, and urbanization metrics may contribute to disparities in life expectancy. By addressing these queries, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between demographic, environmental, and societal factors that shape the life expectancy in Alberta.  

This README is taken from the introduction of my teams report, which was collaborated on by my classmates Abdul Suhaib, Nadeem Batshawi, Carlos Arteaga, and Jeff Foster. If you'd like more information on the full report and my teams findings, you can find them in the PDF report linked in this repository. Within this repository, you can find our code used to create the project. This includes python to clean our data, wrangle the data, and create our database. We then utilized mySQL/ SQL Alchemy to implement SQL queries on our data and find meaningful insights. The project was a great learning process on workflow of how to create a database and utlize SQL to explore the data further.
